This project is based on [Create React App v2](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and [netlify-lambda v1](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-lambda). (For more information about Create react App, check their full [documentation](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app#create-react-app).)

The main addition is a new folder: `src/lambda`. Each JavaScript file in there will automatically be prepared for Lambda function deployment.

As an example, we've included a small `src/lambda/hello.js` function, which will be deployed to `/.netlify/functions/hello`. We've also included an async lambda example using async/await syntax in `async-chuck-norris.js`.

## Babel/webpack compilation

All functions are compiled with webpack using the Babel Loader, so you can use modern JavaScript, import npm modules, etc., without any extra setup.

## Local Development

Before developing, clone the repository and run `yarn` from the root of the repo to install all dependencies.

### Option 1: Starting both servers at once

Most people should be able to get up and running just by running:

```bash
yarn start
```

This uses [npm-run-all](https://github.com/mysticatea/npm-run-all#readme) to run the functions dev server and app dev server concurrently.

### Option 2: Start each server individually

**Run the functions dev server**

From inside the project folder, run:

```
yarn start:lambda
```

This will open a local server running at `http://localhost:9000` serving your Lambda functions, updating as you make changes in the `src/lambda` folder.

You can then access your functions directly at `http://localhost:9000/{function_name}`, but to access them with the app, you'll need to start the app dev server. Under the hood, this uses `react-scripts`' [advanced proxy feature](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#configuring-the-proxy-manually) with the `setupProxy.js` file.

**Run the app dev server**

While the functions server is still running, open a new terminal tab and run:

```
yarn start:app
```

This will start the normal create-react-app dev server and open your app at `http://localhost:3000`.

Local in-app requests to the relative path `/.netlify/functions/*` will automatically be proxied to the local functions dev server.

## Typescript

  </summary>
You can use Typescript in both your React code (with `react-scripts` v2.1+) and your lambda functions )with `netlify-lambda` v1.1+). Follow these instructions:

1. `yarn add -D typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @babel/preset-typescript @types/aws-lambda`
2. convert `src/lambda/hello.js` to `src/lambda/hello.ts`
3. use types in your event handler:

```ts
import { Handler, Context, Callback, APIGatewayEvent } from 'aws-lambda';

interface HelloResponse {
  statusCode: number;
  body: string;
}

const handler: Handler = (
  event: APIGatewayEvent,
  context: Context,
  callback: Callback
) => {
  const params = event.queryStringParameters;
  const response: HelloResponse = {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify({
      msg: `Hello world ${Math.floor(Math.random() * 10)}`,
      params
    })
  };

  callback(undefined, response);
};

export { handler };
```

rerun and see it work!

You are free to set up your `tsconfig.json` and `tslint` as you see fit.

**If you want to try working in Typescript on the client and lambda side**: There are a bunch of small setup details to get right. Check https://github.com/sw-yx/create-react-app-lambda-typescript for a working starter.

## Routing and authentication

For a full demo of routing and authentication, check this branch: https://github.com/netlify/create-react-app-lambda/pull/18 This example will not be maintained but may be helpful.

## Service Worker

The service worker does not work with lambda functions out of the box. It prevents calling the function and returns the app itself instead ([Read more](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/2237#issuecomment-302693219)). To solve this you have to eject and enhance the service worker configuration in the webpack config. Whitelist the path of your lambda function and you are good to go.
